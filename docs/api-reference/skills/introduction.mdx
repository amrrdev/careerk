| Field        | Type     | Required | Description                           |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `skillId`    | string   | No\*     | UUID of existing skill                |
| `skillIds`   | string[] | No\*     | Array of skill UUIDs                  |
| `skillName`  | string   | No\*     | Name of skill (creates if not exists) |
| `skillNames` | string[] | No\*     | Array of skill names                  |
| `verified`   | boolean  | Always   | `true` if from CV, `false` if manual  |

\*At least one of `skillId`, `skillIds`, `skillName`, or `skillNames` is required.

## Verification Status

| Value   | Description                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `true`  | Skill verified from CV parsing         |
| `false` | Skill manually added by the job seeker |

## Notes

- Skills can be added by ID (must exist) or by name (creates if not exists)
- Duplicate skill additions are handled gracefully (returns existing)
- Deleting a skill removes only the association, not the skill itself

See detailed documentation for each endpoint in the API Reference section.
