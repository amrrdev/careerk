# Skill Gap Analysis API

The Skill Gap Analysis API helps job seekers evaluate profile readiness for a target role and get
actionable recommendations.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1
```

## Endpoints Overview

| Method | Endpoint                                 | Description                    | Auth Required    |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| POST   | `/job-seekers/me/skill-analysis`         | Start a new analysis           | Yes (Job Seeker) |
| GET    | `/job-seekers/me/skill-analysis/latest`  | Get most recent analysis       | Yes (Job Seeker) |
| GET    | `/job-seekers/me/skill-analysis/:id`     | Get a specific analysis by ID  | Yes (Job Seeker) |
| GET    | `/job-seekers/me/skill-analysis/history` | Get paginated analysis history | Yes (Job Seeker) |

## How It Works

1. Frontend calls `POST /job-seekers/me/skill-analysis` to start analysis.
2. API returns immediately with `status: PROCESSING`.
3. Background worker generates results asynchronously.
4. Frontend polls `GET /job-seekers/me/skill-analysis/latest` (or uses history/by-id) to read final
   output.

## Analysis Status

| Status       | Meaning |
| ------------ | ------- |
| `PROCESSING` | Analysis is running in background |
| `COMPLETED`  | Analysis finished successfully |
| `FAILED`     | Analysis failed |

## Response Shape (Summary)

Completed analyses typically include:

- `targetRole`
- `cvScore` (0 to 100)
- `strengths` (array of strings)
- `gaps` (array with `skill`, `importance`, `suggestion`)
- `recommendations` (array of strings)
- timestamps like `createdAt` and `completedAt`

## Limits and Behavior

- Weekly limit: up to 10 new analyses per job seeker.
- Weekly window resets on Monday.
- History endpoint is paginated (`page`, `limit`; default `limit` is 10).

## Frontend Integration Tips

- After create, show a "processing" state and retry latest endpoint after 10-30 seconds.
- Keep polling interval reasonable (for example every 3-5 seconds) with timeout handling.
- Use history for older analyses and by-id route for detail views.
