# CV Management

The CV API allows job seekers to upload, retrieve, and delete their CV/resume documents. Each job seeker can have **one CV** at a time. Uploading a new CV replaces the existing one.

## Upload Flow

The CV upload process requires multiple steps:

1. **Request Presigned URL** - Get an upload URL from the server
2. **Upload File** - Upload the file directly to cloud storage
3. **Confirm Upload** - Confirm the upload to finalize it

## Base Endpoint

```
/api/v1/cv
```

<Note>All CV endpoints require **authentication** and **Job Seeker role**.</Note>

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/cv/presigned-url` | Request an upload URL |
| PUT | `{uploadUrl}` | Upload file to cloud storage |
| POST | `/cv/confirm` | Confirm the upload |
| GET | `/cv/me` | Get current CV info |
| GET | `/cv/me/downoad-url` | Get download URL |
| DELETE | `/cv/me` | Delete CV |
