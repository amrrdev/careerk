## Notes

- All endpoints are public (no authentication required)
- Direct jobs support more filters (workPreference, salary, experienceLevel)
- Scraped jobs have limited filters (jobType, location, search)
- For `/jobs?source=all`, results are merged and sorted by date

See detailed documentation for each endpoint in the API Reference section.
