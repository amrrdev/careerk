# CareerK API

This documentation is the integration contract for frontend clients.

## API Base Path

Use this base path for all endpoints:

```text
{API_ORIGIN}/api/v1
```

Local example:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/v1
```

<Note>
  Treat `/api/v1` as the canonical API namespace for frontend development.
</Note>

## Global Response Contract

Most successful responses are wrapped in a consistent envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "Success",
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2026-02-27T00:00:00.000Z",
    "path": "/jobs",
    "method": "GET"
  }
}
```

### Frontend Notes

- `data` contains endpoint-specific payload.
- `message` is human-readable and can be shown in toasts/snackbars.
- `meta` is useful for logging, debugging, and tracing.

## Global Error Contract

Errors are returned in this envelope:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Unauthorized",
    "statusCode": 401,
    "timestamp": "2026-02-27T00:00:00.000Z",
    "path": "/jobs/bookmarks",
    "method": "GET",
    "details": "Bad Request"
  }
}
```

### Frontend Notes

- Always read `error.statusCode` for control flow.
- `error.message` may be a string or an array (especially for validation errors).
- `error.details` is optional.

## Authentication Model

CareerK uses access token + refresh token authentication.

- Access token: sent in `Authorization` header.
- Refresh token: stored in an HTTP-only cookie named `refreshToken`.
- Protected endpoints: require valid access token.
- Role-protected endpoints: return `403` when user role is not allowed.

Authorization header format:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
```

<Warning>
  Use `credentials: 'include'` for browser requests so refresh-token cookie flow works correctly.
</Warning>


## Query and Pagination Conventions

Most list endpoints support:

- `page` (default commonly `1`)
- `limit` (default commonly `20`)
- endpoint-specific filters (for example `search`, `location`, `jobType`)

Use query params as strings in URLs, for example:

```text
/jobs?page=1&limit=20&search=frontend
```

## File Upload Flow (CV)

CV upload is a multi-step flow:

1. Request a pre-signed upload URL from API.
2. Upload file directly to storage using returned `uploadUrl`.
3. Confirm upload with API.
4. Optionally preview and confirm parsed data.

<Tip>
  The direct upload request (`PUT {uploadUrl}`) is against storage, not the CareerK API host.
</Tip>

## Status Code Guide

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| 200 | Success |
| 201 | Created |
| 400 | Validation or bad request |
| 401 | Missing/invalid authentication |
| 403 | Authenticated but not authorized for role/resource |
| 404 | Resource not found |
| 409 | Conflict (duplicate/resource state conflict) |
| 500 | Internal server error |
